# Fahad's project
## Used technology :
Visual studio code, git, html, css, jQuery and js.
I also used "sweet alert" to show the winning result.

## Approach taken:
I devided my page into 3 divs, one for the whole page,one for the play board and one for each cell.
each cell has a general class, X class and O class, we decide the winner from the class if it's X or O.
