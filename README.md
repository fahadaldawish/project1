## what is tic tac toe
it's a game that has a nine cells(3 for each row), to win the game you must fill 3 cells in a row (horizantally , vertically or daigonally).

## Used technologies :
Visual studio code, git, html, css, jQuery and js.
I also used "sweet alert" to show the winning result.

## wireframe 
<img src="images/capture.png">

## Approach taken:
I devided my page into 3 divs, one for the whole page,one for the play board and one for each cell.
each cell has a general class, X class and O class, we decide the winner from the class if it's X or O.
the game starts with the X option.
We have 3 functions :
"play" once the user click on a cell, a class will be assigned to the cell and the text "either X or O" will be written inside it. 
"winner" to check each winning option by comparing the classes inside each cell;
"reset" this function will return everything to the original page and it will be applied after decideng the winner, the game ends with a tie or clicking the "play again" button.

## project status:
